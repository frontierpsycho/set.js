# Set.js

An implementation of [Set](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1198/set) in JavaScript, complete with a solver.

# Running

The project includes a rudimentary main file that creates a random board (not protecting against duplicates) and finds all sets in it. It prints both. To run:
```
$ node index.js
```

# Tests

Unit tests were written using Mocha and Chai.expect.

```
$ npm test
```
